# 🐏 RAM
### Production-Grade Infrastructure as Code

**Opinionated • Secure • Repeatable • Hardened by Default**

Ansible-powered deployment stacks for Docker edge gateways, developer environments, and modern application platforms — built for Ubuntu 24.04 and real-world production systems.

## What is Ram?

**Ram** is a curated infrastructure repository focused on **production-ready deployment patterns**, not demos or toy examples. Every stack is designed to be secure by default, easy to audit, and safe to evolve — using **Ansible as the control plane** and **Docker as the execution layer**.

This repo exists to eliminate:
- Snowflake servers
- Undocumented infra decisions
- Fragile copy-paste stacks
- Security-last configurations

## Core Stacks

- 🔐 **Edge Gateway**
  - NGINX reverse proxy
  - Let’s Encrypt automation
  - Hardened TLS and routing

- 🧑‍💻 **VS Code Server Stack**
  - Secure remote development environments
  - Team-friendly workflows

- 🚀 **Application Platform**
  - Apache 2.4
  - PHP 8.2
  - PostgreSQL 17 + PostGIS
  - Production-grade container layouts

## Philosophy

- **Secure by default**
- **Minimal but complete**
- **Composable and auditable**
- **Built for real systems, not tutorials**
- **Infrastructure is documentation**

## Roadmap

Ram will expand into:
Kubernetes, observability, CI/CD pipelines, data platforms, edge compute, and more — all built with the same production discipline.

If you build infrastructure that must *survive reality*, Ram is for you 🐏
